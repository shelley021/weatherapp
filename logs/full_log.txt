In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws.
