  --ndk-dir NDK_DIR, --ndk_dir NDK_DIR
                        The filepath where the Android NDK is installed
  --android-api ANDROID_API, --android_api ANDROID_API
                        The Android API level to build against defaults to 33

  --ndk-version NDK_VERSION, --ndk_version NDK_VERSION
                        DEPRECATED: the NDK version is now found automatically
                        or not at all.
  --ndk-api NDK_API     The Android API level to compile against. This should
                        be your *minimal supported* API, not normally the same
                        as your --android-api. Defaults to min(ANDROID_API,

  --symlink-bootstrap-files, --ssymlink_bootstrap_files
                        If True, symlinks the bootstrap files creation. This
                        is useful for development only, it could also cause

  --recipe-blacklist RECIPE_BLACKLIST
                        Blacklist an internal recipe from use. Allows
                        disabling Python 3 core modules to save size
  --blacklist-requirements BLACKLIST_REQUIREMENTS
                        Blacklist an internal recipe from use. Allows
